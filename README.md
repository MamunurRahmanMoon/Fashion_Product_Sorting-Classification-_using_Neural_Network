# 🧥 Fashion Product Sorting with Neural Networks 👗

Welcome to the **Fashion Product Sorting** project! This project leverages deep learning and computer vision to classify fashion products into various categories using the **Fashion MNIST dataset**. The model is deployed as a web application using **Streamlit**, allowing users to upload images of fashion items and get predictions with confidence scores.

---

## 📖 About
This project is a deep learning-based solution for classifying fashion products into categories like T-shirts, trousers, dresses, and more. It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset and provides a user-friendly interface for predictions. The goal is to demonstrate the power of neural networks in image classification tasks while providing an interactive experience.

## 🚀 Features
- **Image Classification**: Classifies fashion products into 10 categories.
- **Interactive Web App**: Built with Streamlit for easy image uploads and predictions.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Includes grayscale conversion, resizing, and normalization for consistent input to the model.
- **Confidence Scores**: Displays the model's confidence for each prediction.
- **Download Processed Images**: Allows users to download preprocessed images for further analysis.

## 📂 Dataset
The project uses the **Fashion MNIST dataset**, which contains 70,000 grayscale images of 10 different fashion categories:
- T-shirt/top
- Trouser
- Pullover
- Dress
- Coat
- Sandal
- Shirt
- Sneaker
- Bag
- Ankle boot

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for building the project.
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the neural network.
- **Streamlit**: For creating the web application.
- **Pillow**: For image preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.

## 📋 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/FashionProductSorting.git
   cd FashionProductSorting

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py

🖼️ How It Works
Upload an Image: Upload an image of a fashion product (e.g., T-shirt, dress, etc.).
Preprocessing: The image is converted to grayscale, resized to 28x28 pixels, and normalized.
Prediction: The preprocessed image is passed through the trained neural network to predict the category.
Results: The app displays the predicted category along with the confidence score.

📊 Model Performance
Training Accuracy: 95%
Testing Accuracy: 87%
Challenges: The model occasionally overfits and struggles with unseen data. Efforts to improve include data augmentation, regularization, and better preprocessing.

📝 Future Improvements
Add support for more diverse datasets.
Improve preprocessing to handle real-world images better.
Implement advanced techniques like transfer learning for better accuracy.
Add more interactivity to the web app, such as visualizing intermediate layers.
